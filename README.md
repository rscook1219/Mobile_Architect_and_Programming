***Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?***

-The primary goal of this app is to address the need of individuals to monitor their weight daily. The app allows users to input their weight daily and view their progress towards their goal. This can help users stay motivated and maintain a healthier lifestyle. 


***What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?***

-The home screen was designed for the users to either log in for returning users or create an account. The weight entry screen was created for the users to input their daily weight and it saves it to the history which can be viewed from a different page that was created so the users can see where they stand on the way to their overall goal weight. The UI designs were created with the intended users in mind. They focus on simplicity and ease of use. The buttons were created to be large and brighter colored and the input fields are also large so the user can quickly add weight and view their previously entered data. 


***How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?***

-When creating the app, I focused on modular design, reusable components, and the model-view-controller pattern. The modular design allowed for breaking the app down into smaller components to make it more manageable and help to simplify the development process and any maintenance that may be needed. I also focused on using reusable components to ensure there is consistency across the app and help to reduce redundancy. The MVC patter was used to separate concerns and improve the overall organization of the code. 


***How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?***

-I used a variety of testing techniques to make sure my app was functional and hit all the cores that the user may need. I used Unit, integration, and User testing. Unit testing was used to test all the components and make sure they all functioned as needed without any errors. Integration testing was used to make sure that all the different parts of the app work together seamlessly. User testing was used to get feedback from real users (my CrossFit wife) and see if there were any usability issues or any features that the user would like to see in future updates or if it was an easy add in then I could add it in before launch. Testing is very crucial as it can help you find any bugs that need to be fixed before launch. This can also help reveal any areas of improvement that may be needed/wanted. 


***Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?***

-Throughout the development process, several challenges were encountered and overcome through innovation. One significant challenge was efficiently handling and displaying a large amount of weight data in the history screen. This was addressed by optimizing the data handling and ensuring smooth scrolling and quick access to historical data.


***In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?***

-The component where I particularly demonstrated my knowledge, skills, and experience was in implementing the history screen. Creating an efficient and user-friendly history screen that accurately reflects the user's weight data required a deep understanding of data management and UI design principles. The success of this feature showcases my ability to translate complex requirements into functional and user-friendly solutions.
